Android Weather Application

- Create a list based application where the list should be pre-populated with at least 3 entries, where each entry represents a different US zip code.

- There should be an 'Add' button that allows the user to add additional zip codes into the list.  When adding a zip, the user should be presented with a 'Detailsâ€™ page. Tapping on a list item will make an API call to a weather service of your choice and display the weather data in a detail activity. Ideally, the weather results are cached and persisted.

- The user should be able to navigate back to the list and select another zip to display the 'Details' page for it.


Challenges:
- Designing UI
- Preferred method of storing weather data
